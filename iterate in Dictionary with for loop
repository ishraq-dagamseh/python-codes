Quiz: Fruit Basket - Task 1
You would like to count the number of fruits in your basket. In order to do this, you have the following dictionary and list of fruits. Use the dictionary and list to count the total number of fruits, but you do not want to count the other items in your basket.

for key,value in basket_items.items():
    for i in fruits:    # or using this #for object, count in basket_items.items():if object in fruits:result += count
        if i== key:
            result+=value
result=result
# You would like to count the number of fruits in your basket. 
# In order to do this, you have the following dictionary and list of
# fruits.  Use the dictionary and list to count the total number
# of fruits, but you do not want to count the other items in your basket.
​
result = 0
basket_items = {'apples': 4, 'oranges': 19, 'kites': 3, 'sandwiches': 8}
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'peaches', 'grapes', 'bananas']
​
#Iterate through the dictionary
for key,value in basket_items.items():
    for i in fruits:
        if i== key:
            result+=value
result=result
print(result)
    
#if the key is in the list of fruits, add the value (number of fruits) to result

Quiz: Fruit Basket - Task 2
If your solution is robust, you should be able to use it with any dictionary of items to count the number of fruits in the basket. Try the loop for each of the dictionaries below to make sure it always works.

Quiz: Fruit Basket - Task 3
So, a couple of things about the above examples:

It is a bit annoying having to copy and paste all the code to each spot - wouldn't it be nice to have a way to repeat the process without copying all the code? Don't worry! You will learn how to do this in the next lesson!
It would be nice to keep track of both the number of fruits and other items in the basket.
Use the environment below to try out this second part.

sol:
# You would like to count the number of fruits in your basket. 
# In order to do this, you have the following dictionary and list of
# fruits.  Use the dictionary and list to count the total number
# of fruits and not_fruits.

for key,value in basket_items.items():
#if the key is in the list of fruits, add to fruit_count.

#if the key is not in the list, then add to the not_fruit_count
